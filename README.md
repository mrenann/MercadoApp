# ðŸ›’ Mercado Libre

A mobile application that allows users to search and view product details using Mercado Libre's mock APIs. Built with Jetpack Compose and modern Android architecture.

## Observations
**Notice: Temporary Use of Mocked Data Due to API Authentication Issue**

During development, I attempted to integrate with the MercadoLibre API (developers.mercadolibre.com) for live data retrieval. However, despite successfully generating an access token, the API consistently returned a 403 Forbidden error:
```
{  
  "message": "forbidden",  
  "error": "forbidden",  
  "status": 403,  
  "cause": []  
}  
```

## Technologies
- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern declarative UI toolkit
- **Voyager** - Navigation library for Compose
- **Koin** - Dependency injection
- **Coil** - Image loading
- **Zoomable** - Image zoom capabilities
- **Lyricist** - Multi-language support
- **Gson** - JSON parsing
- **JUnit, MockK, Turbine** - Testing framework

## Structure
- **MVVM** - Clear separation between View (UI components), ViewModel (business logic and state management), and Model (data layer).
- **Clean Architecture** - Layered structure divided into:
  - **Data**: Handles data sources (local, remote) and implementation details.
  - **Domain**: Contains business rules, entities, and interfaces (abstractions).
  - **Presentation**: Manages UI, state, and user interactions.
- **SOLID** - Five principles to write maintainable, scalable, and testable code:
  - **Single Responsibility (SRP)**: A class should have one reason to change.
  - **Open/Closed (OCP)**: Classes should be open for extension (via inheritance/composition) but closed for modification.
  - **Liskov Substitution (LSP)**: Subtypes must be replaceable with their base types without breaking behavior.
  - **Interface Segregation (ISP)**: Avoid forcing clients to depend on unused methods. Split large interfaces.
  - **Dependency Inversion (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations.
